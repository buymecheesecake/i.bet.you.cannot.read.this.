try.to.read.it.i.bet.you.can't. allows you to read the internet in gibberish instead of letters. It takes everything you know about reading... and makes it mildly impossible.  No reason, no rules, just for fun.  


## What it does 😌
1. Replaces alphabet characters (A–Z, a–z) with a unique symbol aesthetic

2. Swaps specific words like dog and cat into creatures and cuteness

3. Works instantly on any website you visit

4. Probably makes no sense, and that’s the point 

## How to install ⚙️
1. Download the ZIP or clone the repo

2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser

3. Enable Developer mode

4. Click Load unpacked and select the unzipped folder

5. Open any website and enjoy the chaos
