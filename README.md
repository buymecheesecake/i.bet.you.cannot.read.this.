### try to read it i bet you can't
Ever wondered what it’s like to read the internet in gibberish instead of letters? This Chrome extension replaces some words and letters with symbols, and soft aesthetic noise. Perfect for confusing friends, dodging productivity, or just making your tabs a little more ✧･ﾟweird✧･ﾟ. It takes everything you know about reading... and makes it mildly impossible. Every website becomes a cryptic wonderland of sparkles, cats, and soft unicode chaos. No reason, no rules, just for fun.

😌 **What it does**
Replaces alphabet characters (A–Z, a–z) with a unique symbol aesthetic

Swaps specific words like dog and cat into creatures and cuteness

Works instantly on any website you visit

Probably makes no sense, and that’s the point 

⚙️ **How to install**
Download the ZIP or clone the repo

Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser

Enable Developer mode

Click Load unpacked and select the unzipped folder

Open any website and enjoy the chaos

🌈 Sample:
